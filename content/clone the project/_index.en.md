All of the projects and files exist in a GitHub repository, where you can also view the revision history of each file in the repository (repo). To clone the code for the tutorials, you’ll use the PIO interface:

Click the PlatformIO logo on the VS Code activity bar (left most menu).
From PlatformIO’s Quick Access menu, under Miscellaneous, select Clone Git Project.
Paste `https://github.com/waymousa/TFLite_Voice_Commands.git` into the text field and then select the location you want to save the project in.
