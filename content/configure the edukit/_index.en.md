4. Use the direction keys on your keyboard to go to Component config â€“> Amazon Web Services IoT Platform and open AWS IoT Endpoint Hostname to set the string. You can paste the address you copied moments ago into the box and hit enter to set that symbol. Next, go back to the configuration home screen by pressing the ESC key twice. Then select AWS IoT EduKit Configuration from the menu. Set your WiFi SSID and WiFi Password with your Wi-FI credentials.
